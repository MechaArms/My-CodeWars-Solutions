'''
Write a function that takes an array of numbers (integers for the tests) and a target number. It should find two different items in the array that, when added together, give the target value. The indices of these items should then be returned in a tuple / list (depending on your language) like so: (index1, index2).

For the purposes of this kata, some tests may have multiple answers; any valid solutions will be accepted.

The input will always be valid (numbers will be an array of length 2 or greater, and all of the items will be numbers; target will always be the sum of two different items from that array).

Based on: http://oj.leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/

two_sum([1, 2, 3], 4) # returns [0, 2] or [2, 0]

Example:

Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

def two_sum(numbers, target):
    x = 0
    for i in range(len(numbers)):
        for j in range(len(numbers)):
            x = numbers[i] + numbers[j]
            if x == target and i != j:
                return [i, j]
